# VBA_Challenge - Data Analysis and Visualization Course
# Wall Street Stock Data
# Function
This data has just the open close and daily prices for each stock. The Goal was to create VBA functions that could make a yearly change, percent change and total stock volume based on just the daily prices. 
After creating that column, the app then takes the greatest % increase and decrease as well as the volume of the top ticker and puts it into a table. 
# Organization
This is all done in VBA, so the function is a one-run function. You have the raw data then you can run the VBA to manipulate the given data set.
# How to Run
This dataset has already been changed but you can go through and look at the code as well as the finished product.
